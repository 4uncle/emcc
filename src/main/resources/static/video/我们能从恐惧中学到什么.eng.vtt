00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.749
One day in 1819,

00:00:18.095 --> 00:00:20.095
3,000 miles off the coast of Chile,

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.854
in one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean,

00:00:23.784 --> 00:00:27.784
20 American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater.

00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:30.824
They'd been struck by a sperm whale, which had ripped

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:32.004
a catastrophic hole in the ship's hull.

00:00:32.905 --> 00:00:35.905
As their ship began to sink beneath the swells,

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:39.234
the men huddled together in three small whaleboats.

00:00:39.547 --> 00:00:41.547
These men were 10,000 miles from home,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.810
more than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land.

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:47.033
In their small boats, they carried only

00:00:47.237 --> 00:00:48.237
rudimentary navigational equipment

00:00:48.803 --> 00:00:52.803
and limited supplies of food and water.

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:54.451
These were the men of the whaleship Essex,

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:57.655
whose story would later inspire parts of "Moby Dick."

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.310
Even in today's world, their situation would be really dire,

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:02.259
but think about how much worse it would have been then.

00:01:02.185 --> 00:01:05.185
No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.410
No search party was coming to look for these men.

00:01:08.322 --> 00:01:11.322
So most of us have never experienced a situation

00:01:11.184 --> 00:01:14.184
as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves,

00:01:14.687 --> 00:01:16.687
but we all know what it's like to be afraid.

00:01:16.554 --> 00:01:18.554
We know how fear feels,

00:01:18.848 --> 00:01:20.848
but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about

00:01:20.952 --> 00:01:22.952
what our fears mean.

00:01:22.597 --> 00:01:25.597
As we grow up, we're often encouraged to think of fear

00:01:25.434 --> 00:01:28.434
as a weakness, just another childish thing to discard

00:01:28.347 --> 00:01:31.347
like baby teeth or roller skates.

00:01:31.165 --> 00:01:33.165
And I think it's no accident that we think this way.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.660
Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings

00:01:36.267 --> 00:01:39.267
are hard-wired to be optimists.

00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:41.006
So maybe that's why we think of fear, sometimes,

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.789
as a danger in and of itself.

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:46.767
"Don't worry," we like to say to one another. "Don't panic."

00:01:46.764 --> 00:01:49.764
In English, fear is something we conquer.

00:01:49.413 --> 00:01:53.413
It's something we fight. It's something we overcome.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.246
But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way?

00:01:55.451 --> 00:01:59.451
What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination,

00:01:59.594 --> 00:02:01.594
something that can be as profound and insightful

00:02:01.972 --> 00:02:04.972
as storytelling itself?

00:02:04.626 --> 00:02:07.626
It's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.219
in young children, whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid.

00:02:10.498 --> 00:02:12.498
When I was a child, I lived in California,

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.779
which is, you know, mostly a very nice place to live,

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:19.468
but for me as a child, California could also be a little scary.

00:02:19.476 --> 00:02:22.476
I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:24.517
that hung above our dining table swing back and forth

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.950
during every minor earthquake,

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:29.125
and I sometimes couldn't sleep at night, terrified

00:02:29.428 --> 00:02:31.428
that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping.

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.949
And what we say about kids who have fears like that

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:38.821
is that they have a vivid imagination.

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.049
But at a certain point, most of us learn

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.439
to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up.

00:02:43.325 --> 00:02:46.325
We learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed,

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:49.082
and not every earthquake brings buildings down.

00:02:49.062 --> 00:02:52.062
But maybe it's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.470
fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults.

00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:59.581
The same incredible imaginations that produced "The Origin of Species,"

00:02:59.442 --> 00:03:02.442
"Jane Eyre" and "The Remembrance of Things Past,"

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.299
also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives

00:03:05.638 --> 00:03:10.638
of Charles Darwin, Charlotte Bront?? and Marcel Proust.

00:03:10.094 --> 00:03:13.094
So the question is, what can the rest of us learn about fear

00:03:13.023 --> 00:03:16.023
from visionaries and young children?

00:03:16.327 --> 00:03:19.327
Well let's return to the year 1819 for a moment,

00:03:19.187 --> 00:03:22.187
to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex.

00:03:22.874 --> 00:03:24.874
Let's take a look at the fears that their imaginations

00:03:24.993 --> 00:03:28.993
were generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific.

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:32.749
Twenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship.

00:03:32.298 --> 00:03:35.298
The time had come for the men to make a plan,

00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:37.001
but they had very few options.

00:03:37.727 --> 00:03:40.727
In his fascinating account of the disaster,

00:03:40.158 --> 00:03:42.158
Nathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just about

00:03:42.898 --> 00:03:47.898
as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth.

00:03:47.298 --> 00:03:49.298
The men knew that the nearest islands they could reach

00:03:49.598 --> 00:03:53.598
were the Marquesas Islands, 1,200 miles away.

00:03:53.374 --> 00:03:55.374
But they'd heard some frightening rumors.

00:03:55.896 --> 00:03:57.896
They'd been told that these islands,

00:03:57.574 --> 00:04:01.574
and several others nearby, were populated by cannibals.

00:04:01.818 --> 00:04:04.818
So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered

00:04:04.194 --> 00:04:05.194
and eaten for dinner.

00:04:05.835 --> 00:04:08.835
Another possible destination was Hawaii,

00:04:08.587 --> 00:04:10.587
but given the season, the captain was afraid

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.459
they'd be struck by severe storms.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.680
Now the last option was the longest, and the most difficult:

00:04:17.472 --> 00:04:21.472
to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching

00:04:21.096 --> 00:04:22.096
a certain band of winds that could eventually

00:04:22.985 --> 00:04:25.985
push them toward the coast of South America.

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:27.249
But they knew that the sheer length of this journey

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.970
would stretch their supplies of food and water.

00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:34.481
To be eaten by cannibals, to be battered by storms,

00:04:34.887 --> 00:04:38.887
to starve to death before reaching land.

00:04:38.248 --> 00:04:41.248
These were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men,

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.640
and as it turned out, the fear they chose to listen to

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:47.539
would govern whether they lived or died.

00:04:47.193 --> 00:04:51.193
Now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name.

00:04:51.403 --> 00:04:53.403
What if instead of calling them fears,

00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:55.681
we called them stories?

00:04:55.292 --> 00:04:57.292
Because that's really what fear is, if you think about it.

00:04:57.525 --> 00:05:00.525
It's a kind of unintentional storytelling

00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:03.585
that we are all born knowing how to do.

00:05:03.515 --> 00:05:06.515
And fears and storytelling have the same components.

00:05:06.278 --> 00:05:08.278
They have the same architecture.

00:05:08.143 --> 00:05:10.143
Like all stories, fears have characters.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.820
In our fears, the characters are us.

00:05:13.243 --> 00:05:17.243
Fears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends.

00:05:17.545 --> 00:05:21.545
You board the plane. The plane takes off. The engine fails.

00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:24.661
Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.229
every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel.

00:05:27.578 --> 00:05:30.578
Picture a cannibal, human teeth

00:05:30.534 --> 00:05:32.534
sinking into human skin,

00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:35.741
human flesh roasting over a fire.

00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:38.795
Fears also have suspense.

00:05:38.531 --> 00:05:40.531
If I've done my job as a storyteller today,

00:05:40.821 --> 00:05:42.821
you should be wondering what happened

00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:44.329
to the men of the whaleship Essex.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.430
Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense.

00:05:48.675 --> 00:05:52.675
Just like all great stories, our fears focus our attention

00:05:52.228 --> 00:05:56.228
on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature:

00:05:56.167 --> 00:05:58.167
What will happen next?

00:05:58.924 --> 00:06:01.924
In other words, our fears make us think about the future.

00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:03.628
And humans, by the way, are the only creatures capable

00:06:03.646 --> 00:06:05.646
of thinking about the future in this way,

00:06:05.316 --> 00:06:08.316
of projecting ourselves forward in time,

00:06:08.207 --> 00:06:10.207
and this mental time travel is just one more thing

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:14.619
that fears have in common with storytelling.

00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:16.241
As a writer, I can tell you that a big part of writing fiction

00:06:16.734 --> 00:06:18.734
is learning to predict how one event in a story

00:06:18.617 --> 00:06:20.617
will affect all the other events,

00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:22.361
and fear works in that same way.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.410
In fear, just like in fiction, one thing always leads to another.

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:30.587
When I was writing my first novel, "The Age Of Miracles,"

00:06:30.233 --> 00:06:33.233
I spent months trying to figure out what would happen

00:06:33.194 --> 00:06:36.194
if the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down.

00:06:36.383 --> 00:06:39.383
What would happen to our days? What would happen to our crops?

00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:41.275
What would happen to our minds?

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:44.318
And then it was only later that I realized how very similar

00:06:44.424 --> 00:06:46.424
these questions were to the ones I used to ask myself

00:06:46.545 --> 00:06:48.545
as a child frightened in the night.

00:06:48.782 --> 00:06:51.782
If an earthquake strikes tonight, I used to worry,

00:06:51.313 --> 00:06:55.313
what will happen to our house? What will happen to my family?

00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:59.179
And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story.

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:02.879
So if we think of our fears as more than just fears

00:07:02.382 --> 00:07:05.382
but as stories, we should think of ourselves

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:07.309
as the authors of those stories.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.540
But just as importantly, we need to think of ourselves

00:07:09.502 --> 00:07:12.502
as the readers of our fears, and how we choose

00:07:12.006 --> 00:07:16.006
to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives.

00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:19.341
Now, some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others.

00:07:19.342 --> 00:07:22.342
I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs,

00:07:22.263 --> 00:07:24.263
and the author found that these people shared a habit

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:28.889
that he called "productive paranoia," which meant that

00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:30.248
these people, instead of dismissing their fears,

00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:33.769
these people read them closely, they studied them,

00:07:33.432 --> 00:07:37.432
and then they translated that fear into preparation and action.

00:07:37.032 --> 00:07:38.032
So that way, if their worst fears came true,

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:41.949
their businesses were ready.

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:45.027
And sometimes, of course, our worst fears do come true.

00:07:45.378 --> 00:07:48.378
That's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear.

00:07:48.537 --> 00:07:53.537
Once in a while, our fears can predict the future.

00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:56.459
But we can't possibly prepare for all of the fears

00:07:56.854 --> 00:07:59.854
that our imaginations concoct.

00:07:59.252 --> 00:08:01.252
So how can we tell the difference between

00:08:01.236 --> 00:08:05.236
the fears worth listening to and all the others?

00:08:05.056 --> 00:08:07.056
I think the end of the story of the whaleship Essex

00:08:07.533 --> 00:08:11.533
offers an illuminating, if tragic, example.

00:08:11.816 --> 00:08:16.816
After much deliberation, the men finally made a decision.

00:08:16.543 --> 00:08:20.543
Terrified of cannibals, they decided to forgo the closest islands

00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:22.416
and instead embarked on the longer

00:08:22.743 --> 00:08:25.743
and much more difficult route to South America.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.870
After more than two months at sea, the men ran out of food

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.340
as they knew they might,

00:08:30.419 --> 00:08:33.419
and they were still quite far from land.

00:08:33.114 --> 00:08:36.114
When the last of the survivors were finally picked up

00:08:36.001 --> 00:08:40.001
by two passing ships, less than half of the men were left alive,

00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:45.487
and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.390
Herman Melville, who used this story as research for "Moby Dick,"

00:08:48.753 --> 00:08:52.753
wrote years later, and from dry land, quote,

00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:55.633
"All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex

00:08:55.257 --> 00:08:57.257
might in all human probability have been avoided

00:08:57.946 --> 00:09:00.946
had they, immediately after leaving the wreck,

00:09:00.513 --> 00:09:02.513
steered straight for Tahiti.

00:09:02.394 --> 00:09:06.394
But," as Melville put it, "they dreaded cannibals."

00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:10.959
So the question is, why did these men dread cannibals

00:09:10.005 --> 00:09:14.005
so much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation?

00:09:14.194 --> 00:09:16.194
Why were they swayed by one story

00:09:16.061 --> 00:09:18.061
so much more than the other?

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.700
Looked at from this angle,

00:09:20.222 --> 00:09:23.222
theirs becomes a story about reading.

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:26.521
The novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best reader

00:09:26.177 --> 00:09:28.177
has a combination of two very different temperaments,

00:09:28.976 --> 00:09:31.976
the artistic and the scientific.

00:09:31.826 --> 00:09:34.826
A good reader has an artist's passion,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
a willingness to get caught up in the story,

00:09:36.753 --> 00:09:38.753
but just as importantly, the readers also needs

00:09:38.864 --> 00:09:42.864
the coolness of judgment of a scientist,

00:09:42.075 --> 00:09:43.075
which acts to temper and complicate

00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:46.566
the reader's intuitive reactions to the story.

00:09:46.964 --> 00:09:50.964
As we've seen, the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part.

00:09:50.169 --> 00:09:53.169
They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios.

00:09:53.809 --> 00:09:57.809
The problem was that they listened to the wrong story.

00:09:57.798 --> 00:09:59.798
Of all the narratives their fears wrote,

00:09:59.922 --> 00:10:03.922
they responded only to the most lurid, the most vivid,

00:10:03.573 --> 00:10:06.573
the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture:

00:10:06.792 --> 00:10:08.792
cannibals.

00:10:08.743 --> 00:10:11.743
But perhaps if they'd been able to read their fears

00:10:11.024 --> 00:10:14.024
more like a scientist, with more coolness of judgment,

00:10:14.505 --> 00:10:17.505
they would have listened instead to the less violent

00:10:17.265 --> 00:10:20.265
but the more likely tale, the story of starvation,

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:26.553
and headed for Tahiti, just as Melville's sad commentary suggests.

00:10:26.133 --> 00:10:29.133
And maybe if we all tried to read our fears,

00:10:29.001 --> 00:10:30.001
we too would be less often swayed

00:10:30.978 --> 00:10:32.978
by the most salacious among them.

00:10:32.854 --> 00:10:34.854
Maybe then we'd spend less time worrying about

00:10:34.522 --> 00:10:36.522
serial killers and plane crashes,

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.710
and more time concerned with the subtler

00:10:38.576 --> 00:10:40.576
and slower disasters we face:

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.630
the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries,

00:10:43.378 --> 00:10:45.378
the gradual changes in our climate.

00:10:45.921 --> 00:10:49.921
Just as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest,

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:54.570
so too might our subtlest fears be the truest.

00:10:54.018 --> 00:10:56.018
Read in the right way, our fears are an amazing gift

00:10:56.915 --> 00:10:59.915
of the imagination, a kind of everyday clairvoyance,

00:10:59.847 --> 00:11:02.847
a way of glimpsing what might be the future

00:11:02.082 --> 00:11:05.082
when there's still time to influence how that future will play out.

00:11:05.517 --> 00:11:08.517
Properly read, our fears can offer us something as precious

00:11:08.913 --> 00:11:11.913
as our favorite works of literature:

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.070
a little wisdom, a bit of insight

00:11:14.115 --> 00:11:16.115
and a version of that most elusive thing --

00:11:16.689 --> 00:11:17.689
the truth.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.940
Thank you. (Applause)
