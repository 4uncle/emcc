0:0:15,749 --> 0:0:18,749
One day in 1819,

2
0:0:18,95 --> 0:0:20,95
3,000 miles off the coast of Chile,

3
0:0:20,854 --> 0:0:23,854
in one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean,

4
0:0:23,784 --> 0:0:27,784
20 American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater.

5
0:0:27,824 --> 0:0:30,824
They'd been struck by a sperm whale, which had ripped

6
0:0:30,4 --> 0:0:32,4
a catastrophic hole in the ship's hull.

7
0:0:32,905 --> 0:0:35,905
As their ship began to sink beneath the swells,

8
0:0:35,234 --> 0:0:39,234
the men huddled together in three small whaleboats.

9
0:0:39,547 --> 0:0:41,547
These men were 10,000 miles from home,

10
0:0:41,810 --> 0:0:45,810
more than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land.

11
0:0:45,33 --> 0:0:47,33
In their small boats, they carried only

12
0:0:47,237 --> 0:0:48,237
rudimentary navigational equipment

13
0:0:48,803 --> 0:0:52,803
and limited supplies of food and water.

14
0:0:52,451 --> 0:0:54,451
These were the men of the whaleship Essex,

15
0:0:54,655 --> 0:0:57,655
whose story would later inspire parts of "Moby Dick."

16
0:0:57,310 --> 0:1:0,310
Even in today's world, their situation would be really dire,

17
0:1:0,259 --> 0:1:2,259
but think about how much worse it would have been then.

18
0:1:2,185 --> 0:1:5,185
No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong.

19
0:1:5,410 --> 0:1:8,410
No search party was coming to look for these men.

20
0:1:8,322 --> 0:1:11,322
So most of us have never experienced a situation

21
0:1:11,184 --> 0:1:14,184
as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves,

22
0:1:14,687 --> 0:1:16,687
but we all know what it's like to be afraid.

23
0:1:16,554 --> 0:1:18,554
We know how fear feels,

24
0:1:18,848 --> 0:1:20,848
but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about

25
0:1:20,952 --> 0:1:22,952
what our fears mean.

26
0:1:22,597 --> 0:1:25,597
As we grow up, we're often encouraged to think of fear

27
0:1:25,434 --> 0:1:28,434
as a weakness, just another childish thing to discard

28
0:1:28,347 --> 0:1:31,347
like baby teeth or roller skates.

29
0:1:31,165 --> 0:1:33,165
And I think it's no accident that we think this way.

30
0:1:33,660 --> 0:1:36,660
Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings

31
0:1:36,267 --> 0:1:39,267
are hard-wired to be optimists.

32
0:1:39,6 --> 0:1:41,6
So maybe that's why we think of fear, sometimes,

33
0:1:41,789 --> 0:1:43,789
as a danger in and of itself.

34
0:1:43,767 --> 0:1:46,767
"Don't worry," we like to say to one another. "Don't panic."

35
0:1:46,764 --> 0:1:49,764
In English, fear is something we conquer.

36
0:1:49,413 --> 0:1:53,413
It's something we fight. It's something we overcome.

37
0:1:53,246 --> 0:1:55,246
But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way?

38
0:1:55,451 --> 0:1:59,451
What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination,

39
0:1:59,594 --> 0:2:1,594
something that can be as profound and insightful

40
0:2:1,972 --> 0:2:4,972
as storytelling itself?

41
0:2:4,626 --> 0:2:7,626
It's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination

42
0:2:7,219 --> 0:2:10,219
in young children, whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid.

43
0:2:10,498 --> 0:2:12,498
When I was a child, I lived in California,

44
0:2:12,779 --> 0:2:15,779
which is, you know, mostly a very nice place to live,

45
0:2:15,468 --> 0:2:19,468
but for me as a child, California could also be a little scary.

46
0:2:19,476 --> 0:2:22,476
I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier

47
0:2:22,517 --> 0:2:24,517
that hung above our dining table swing back and forth

48
0:2:24,950 --> 0:2:27,950
during every minor earthquake,

49
0:2:27,125 --> 0:2:29,125
and I sometimes couldn't sleep at night, terrified

50
0:2:29,428 --> 0:2:31,428
that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping.

51
0:2:31,949 --> 0:2:34,949
And what we say about kids who have fears like that

52
0:2:34,821 --> 0:2:38,821
is that they have a vivid imagination.

53
0:2:38,49 --> 0:2:40,49
But at a certain point, most of us learn

54
0:2:40,439 --> 0:2:43,439
to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up.

55
0:2:43,325 --> 0:2:46,325
We learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed,

56
0:2:46,82 --> 0:2:49,82
and not every earthquake brings buildings down.

57
0:2:49,62 --> 0:2:52,62
But maybe it's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds

58
0:2:52,470 --> 0:2:55,470
fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults.

59
0:2:55,581 --> 0:2:59,581
The same incredible imaginations that produced "The Origin of Species,"

60
0:2:59,442 --> 0:3:2,442
"Jane Eyre" and "The Remembrance of Things Past,"

61
0:3:2,299 --> 0:3:5,299
also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives

62
0:3:5,638 --> 0:3:10,638
of Charles Darwin, Charlotte BrontÄ‚Å¤ and Marcel Proust.

63
0:3:10,94 --> 0:3:13,94
So the question is, what can the rest of us learn about fear

64
0:3:13,23 --> 0:3:16,23
from visionaries and young children?

65
0:3:16,327 --> 0:3:19,327
Well let's return to the year 1819 for a moment,

66
0:3:19,187 --> 0:3:22,187
to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex.

67
0:3:22,874 --> 0:3:24,874
Let's take a look at the fears that their imaginations

68
0:3:24,993 --> 0:3:28,993
were generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific.

69
0:3:28,749 --> 0:3:32,749
Twenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship.

70
0:3:32,298 --> 0:3:35,298
The time had come for the men to make a plan,

71
0:3:35,1 --> 0:3:37,1
but they had very few options.

72
0:3:37,727 --> 0:3:40,727
In his fascinating account of the disaster,

73
0:3:40,158 --> 0:3:42,158
Nathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just about

74
0:3:42,898 --> 0:3:47,898
as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth.

75
0:3:47,298 --> 0:3:49,298
The men knew that the nearest islands they could reach

76
0:3:49,598 --> 0:3:53,598
were the Marquesas Islands, 1,200 miles away.

77
0:3:53,374 --> 0:3:55,374
But they'd heard some frightening rumors.

78
0:3:55,896 --> 0:3:57,896
They'd been told that these islands,

79
0:3:57,574 --> 0:4:1,574
and several others nearby, were populated by cannibals.

80
0:4:1,818 --> 0:4:4,818
So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered

81
0:4:4,194 --> 0:4:5,194
and eaten for dinner.

82
0:4:5,835 --> 0:4:8,835
Another possible destination was Hawaii,

83
0:4:8,587 --> 0:4:10,587
but given the season, the captain was afraid

84
0:4:10,459 --> 0:4:13,459
they'd be struck by severe storms.

85
0:4:13,680 --> 0:4:17,680
Now the last option was the longest, and the most difficult:

86
0:4:17,472 --> 0:4:21,472
to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching

87
0:4:21,96 --> 0:4:22,96
a certain band of winds that could eventually

88
0:4:22,985 --> 0:4:25,985
push them toward the coast of South America.

89
0:4:25,249 --> 0:4:27,249
But they knew that the sheer length of this journey

90
0:4:27,970 --> 0:4:31,970
would stretch their supplies of food and water.

91
0:4:31,481 --> 0:4:34,481
To be eaten by cannibals, to be battered by storms,

92
0:4:34,887 --> 0:4:38,887
to starve to death before reaching land.

93
0:4:38,248 --> 0:4:41,248
These were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men,

94
0:4:41,640 --> 0:4:44,640
and as it turned out, the fear they chose to listen to

95
0:4:44,539 --> 0:4:47,539
would govern whether they lived or died.

96
0:4:47,193 --> 0:4:51,193
Now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name.

97
0:4:51,403 --> 0:4:53,403
What if instead of calling them fears,

98
0:4:53,681 --> 0:4:55,681
we called them stories?

99
0:4:55,292 --> 0:4:57,292
Because that's really what fear is, if you think about it.

100
0:4:57,525 --> 0:5:0,525
It's a kind of unintentional storytelling

101
0:5:0,585 --> 0:5:3,585
that we are all born knowing how to do.

102
0:5:3,515 --> 0:5:6,515
And fears and storytelling have the same components.

103
0:5:6,278 --> 0:5:8,278
They have the same architecture.

104
0:5:8,143 --> 0:5:10,143
Like all stories, fears have characters.

105
0:5:10,820 --> 0:5:13,820
In our fears, the characters are us.

106
0:5:13,243 --> 0:5:17,243
Fears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends.

107
0:5:17,545 --> 0:5:21,545
You board the plane. The plane takes off. The engine fails.

108
0:5:21,661 --> 0:5:24,661
Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be

109
0:5:24,229 --> 0:5:27,229
every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel.

110
0:5:27,578 --> 0:5:30,578
Picture a cannibal, human teeth

111
0:5:30,534 --> 0:5:32,534
sinking into human skin,

112
0:5:32,741 --> 0:5:35,741
human flesh roasting over a fire.

113
0:5:35,795 --> 0:5:38,795
Fears also have suspense.

114
0:5:38,531 --> 0:5:40,531
If I've done my job as a storyteller today,

115
0:5:40,821 --> 0:5:42,821
you should be wondering what happened

116
0:5:42,329 --> 0:5:44,329
to the men of the whaleship Essex.

117
0:5:44,430 --> 0:5:48,430
Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense.

118
0:5:48,675 --> 0:5:52,675
Just like all great stories, our fears focus our attention

119
0:5:52,228 --> 0:5:56,228
on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature:

120
0:5:56,167 --> 0:5:58,167
What will happen next?

121
0:5:58,924 --> 0:6:1,924
In other words, our fears make us think about the future.

122
0:6:1,628 --> 0:6:3,628
And humans, by the way, are the only creatures capable

123
0:6:3,646 --> 0:6:5,646
of thinking about the future in this way,

124
0:6:5,316 --> 0:6:8,316
of projecting ourselves forward in time,

125
0:6:8,207 --> 0:6:10,207
and this mental time travel is just one more thing

126
0:6:10,619 --> 0:6:14,619
that fears have in common with storytelling.

127
0:6:14,241 --> 0:6:16,241
As a writer, I can tell you that a big part of writing fiction

128
0:6:16,734 --> 0:6:18,734
is learning to predict how one event in a story

129
0:6:18,617 --> 0:6:20,617
will affect all the other events,

130
0:6:20,361 --> 0:6:22,361
and fear works in that same way.

131
0:6:22,410 --> 0:6:27,410
In fear, just like in fiction, one thing always leads to another.

132
0:6:27,587 --> 0:6:30,587
When I was writing my first novel, "The Age Of Miracles,"

133
0:6:30,233 --> 0:6:33,233
I spent months trying to figure out what would happen

134
0:6:33,194 --> 0:6:36,194
if the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down.

135
0:6:36,383 --> 0:6:39,383
What would happen to our days? What would happen to our crops?

136
0:6:39,275 --> 0:6:41,275
What would happen to our minds?

137
0:6:41,318 --> 0:6:44,318
And then it was only later that I realized how very similar

138
0:6:44,424 --> 0:6:46,424
these questions were to the ones I used to ask myself

139
0:6:46,545 --> 0:6:48,545
as a child frightened in the night.

140
0:6:48,782 --> 0:6:51,782
If an earthquake strikes tonight, I used to worry,

141
0:6:51,313 --> 0:6:55,313
what will happen to our house? What will happen to my family?

142
0:6:55,179 --> 0:6:59,179
And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story.

143
0:6:59,879 --> 0:7:2,879
So if we think of our fears as more than just fears

144
0:7:2,382 --> 0:7:5,382
but as stories, we should think of ourselves

145
0:7:5,309 --> 0:7:7,309
as the authors of those stories.

146
0:7:7,540 --> 0:7:9,540
But just as importantly, we need to think of ourselves

147
0:7:9,502 --> 0:7:12,502
as the readers of our fears, and how we choose

148
0:7:12,6 --> 0:7:16,6
to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives.

149
0:7:16,341 --> 0:7:19,341
Now, some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others.

150
0:7:19,342 --> 0:7:22,342
I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs,

151
0:7:22,263 --> 0:7:24,263
and the author found that these people shared a habit

152
0:7:24,889 --> 0:7:28,889
that he called "productive paranoia," which meant that

153
0:7:28,248 --> 0:7:30,248
these people, instead of dismissing their fears,

154
0:7:30,769 --> 0:7:33,769
these people read them closely, they studied them,

155
0:7:33,432 --> 0:7:37,432
and then they translated that fear into preparation and action.

156
0:7:37,32 --> 0:7:38,32
So that way, if their worst fears came true,

157
0:7:38,949 --> 0:7:41,949
their businesses were ready.

158
0:7:41,27 --> 0:7:45,27
And sometimes, of course, our worst fears do come true.

159
0:7:45,378 --> 0:7:48,378
That's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear.

160
0:7:48,537 --> 0:7:53,537
Once in a while, our fears can predict the future.

161
0:7:53,459 --> 0:7:56,459
But we can't possibly prepare for all of the fears

162
0:7:56,854 --> 0:7:59,854
that our imaginations concoct.

163
0:7:59,252 --> 0:8:1,252
So how can we tell the difference between

164
0:8:1,236 --> 0:8:5,236
the fears worth listening to and all the others?

165
0:8:5,56 --> 0:8:7,56
I think the end of the story of the whaleship Essex

166
0:8:7,533 --> 0:8:11,533
offers an illuminating, if tragic, example.

167
0:8:11,816 --> 0:8:16,816
After much deliberation, the men finally made a decision.

168
0:8:16,543 --> 0:8:20,543
Terrified of cannibals, they decided to forgo the closest islands

169
0:8:20,416 --> 0:8:22,416
and instead embarked on the longer

170
0:8:22,743 --> 0:8:25,743
and much more difficult route to South America.

171
0:8:25,870 --> 0:8:29,870
After more than two months at sea, the men ran out of food

172
0:8:29,340 --> 0:8:30,340
as they knew they might,

173
0:8:30,419 --> 0:8:33,419
and they were still quite far from land.

174
0:8:33,114 --> 0:8:36,114
When the last of the survivors were finally picked up

175
0:8:36,1 --> 0:8:40,1
by two passing ships, less than half of the men were left alive,

176
0:8:40,487 --> 0:8:45,487
and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism.

177
0:8:45,390 --> 0:8:48,390
Herman Melville, who used this story as research for "Moby Dick,"

178
0:8:48,753 --> 0:8:52,753
wrote years later, and from dry land, quote,

179
0:8:52,633 --> 0:8:55,633
"All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex

180
0:8:55,257 --> 0:8:57,257
might in all human probability have been avoided

181
0:8:57,946 --> 0:9:0,946
had they, immediately after leaving the wreck,

182
0:9:0,513 --> 0:9:2,513
steered straight for Tahiti.

183
0:9:2,394 --> 0:9:6,394
But," as Melville put it, "they dreaded cannibals."

184
0:9:6,959 --> 0:9:10,959
So the question is, why did these men dread cannibals

185
0:9:10,5 --> 0:9:14,5
so much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation?

186
0:9:14,194 --> 0:9:16,194
Why were they swayed by one story

187
0:9:16,61 --> 0:9:18,61
so much more than the other?

188
0:9:18,700 --> 0:9:20,700
Looked at from this angle,

189
0:9:20,222 --> 0:9:23,222
theirs becomes a story about reading.

190
0:9:23,521 --> 0:9:26,521
The novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best reader

191
0:9:26,177 --> 0:9:28,177
has a combination of two very different temperaments,

192
0:9:28,976 --> 0:9:31,976
the artistic and the scientific.

193
0:9:31,826 --> 0:9:34,826
A good reader has an artist's passion,

194
0:9:34,330 --> 0:9:36,330
a willingness to get caught up in the story,

195
0:9:36,753 --> 0:9:38,753
but just as importantly, the readers also needs

196
0:9:38,864 --> 0:9:42,864
the coolness of judgment of a scientist,

197
0:9:42,75 --> 0:9:43,75
which acts to temper and complicate

198
0:9:43,566 --> 0:9:46,566
the reader's intuitive reactions to the story.

199
0:9:46,964 --> 0:9:50,964
As we've seen, the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part.

200
0:9:50,169 --> 0:9:53,169
They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios.

201
0:9:53,809 --> 0:9:57,809
The problem was that they listened to the wrong story.

202
0:9:57,798 --> 0:9:59,798
Of all the narratives their fears wrote,

203
0:9:59,922 --> 0:10:3,922
they responded only to the most lurid, the most vivid,

204
0:10:3,573 --> 0:10:6,573
the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture:

205
0:10:6,792 --> 0:10:8,792
cannibals.

206
0:10:8,743 --> 0:10:11,743
But perhaps if they'd been able to read their fears

207
0:10:11,24 --> 0:10:14,24
more like a scientist, with more coolness of judgment,

208
0:10:14,505 --> 0:10:17,505
they would have listened instead to the less violent

209
0:10:17,265 --> 0:10:20,265
but the more likely tale, the story of starvation,

210
0:10:20,553 --> 0:10:26,553
and headed for Tahiti, just as Melville's sad commentary suggests.

211
0:10:26,133 --> 0:10:29,133
And maybe if we all tried to read our fears,

212
0:10:29,1 --> 0:10:30,1
we too would be less often swayed

213
0:10:30,978 --> 0:10:32,978
by the most salacious among them.

214
0:10:32,854 --> 0:10:34,854
Maybe then we'd spend less time worrying about

215
0:10:34,522 --> 0:10:36,522
serial killers and plane crashes,

216
0:10:36,710 --> 0:10:38,710
and more time concerned with the subtler

217
0:10:38,576 --> 0:10:40,576
and slower disasters we face:

218
0:10:40,630 --> 0:10:43,630
the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries,

219
0:10:43,378 --> 0:10:45,378
the gradual changes in our climate.

220
0:10:45,921 --> 0:10:49,921
Just as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest,

221
0:10:49,570 --> 0:10:54,570
so too might our subtlest fears be the truest.

222
0:10:54,18 --> 0:10:56,18
Read in the right way, our fears are an amazing gift

223
0:10:56,915 --> 0:10:59,915
of the imagination, a kind of everyday clairvoyance,

224
0:10:59,847 --> 0:11:2,847
a way of glimpsing what might be the future

225
0:11:2,82 --> 0:11:5,82
when there's still time to influence how that future will play out.

226
0:11:5,517 --> 0:11:8,517
Properly read, our fears can offer us something as precious

227
0:11:8,913 --> 0:11:11,913
as our favorite works of literature:

228
0:11:11,70 --> 0:11:14,70
a little wisdom, a bit of insight

229
0:11:14,115 --> 0:11:16,115
and a version of that most elusive thing --

230
0:11:16,689 --> 0:11:17,689
the truth.

231
0:11:17,940 --> 0:11:22,940
Thank you. (Applause)
