3,000 miles off the coast of Chile,20 American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater.a catastrophic hole in the ship's hull.the men huddled together in three small whaleboats.more than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land.rudimentary navigational equipmentThese were the men of the whaleship Essex,Even in today's world, their situation would be really dire,No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong.So most of us have never experienced a situationbut we all know what it's like to be afraid.but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking aboutAs we grow up, we're often encouraged to think of fearlike baby teeth or roller skates.Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beingsSo maybe that's why we think of fear, sometimes,"Don't worry," we like to say to one another. "Don't panic."It's something we fight. It's something we overcome.What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination,as storytelling itself?in young children, whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid.which is, you know, mostly a very nice place to live,I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelierduring every minor earthquake,that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping.is that they have a vivid imagination.to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up.and not every earthquake brings buildings down.fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults."Jane Eyre" and "The Remembrance of Things Past,"of Charles Darwin, Charlotte Bront膫扭 and Marcel Proust.from visionaries and young children?to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex.were generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific.The time had come for the men to make a plan,In his fascinating account of the disaster,as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth.were the Marquesas Islands, 1,200 miles away.They'd been told that these islands,So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murderedAnother possible destination was Hawaii,they'd be struck by severe storms.to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reachingpush them toward the coast of South America.would stretch their supplies of food and water.to starve to death before reaching land.and as it turned out, the fear they chose to listen toNow we might just as easily call these fears by a different name.we called them stories?It's a kind of unintentional storytellingAnd fears and storytelling have the same components.Like all stories, fears have characters.Fears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends.Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can bePicture a cannibal, human teethhuman flesh roasting over a fire.If I've done my job as a storyteller today,to the men of the whaleship Essex.Just like all great stories, our fears focus our attentionWhat will happen next?And humans, by the way, are the only creatures capableof projecting ourselves forward in time,that fears have in common with storytelling.is learning to predict how one event in a storyand fear works in that same way.When I was writing my first novel, "The Age Of Miracles,"if the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down.What would happen to our minds?these questions were to the ones I used to ask myselfIf an earthquake strikes tonight, I used to worry,And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story.but as stories, we should think of ourselvesBut just as importantly, we need to think of ourselvesto read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives.I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs,that he called "productive paranoia," which meant thatthese people read them closely, they studied them,So that way, if their worst fears came true,And sometimes, of course, our worst fears do come true.Once in a while, our fears can predict the future.that our imaginations concoct.the fears worth listening to and all the others?offers an illuminating, if tragic, example.Terrified of cannibals, they decided to forgo the closest islandsand much more difficult route to South America.as they knew they might,When the last of the survivors were finally picked upand some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism.wrote years later, and from dry land, quote,might in all human probability have been avoidedsteered straight for Tahiti.So the question is, why did these men dread cannibalsWhy were they swayed by one storyLooked at from this angle,The novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best readerthe artistic and the scientific.a willingness to get caught up in the story,the coolness of judgment of a scientist,the reader's intuitive reactions to the story.They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios.Of all the narratives their fears wrote,the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture:But perhaps if they'd been able to read their fearsthey would have listened instead to the less violentand headed for Tahiti, just as Melville's sad commentary suggests.we too would be less often swayedMaybe then we'd spend less time worrying aboutand more time concerned with the subtlerthe silent buildup of plaque in our arteries,Just as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest,Read in the right way, our fears are an amazing gifta way of glimpsing what might be the futureProperly read, our fears can offer us something as preciousa little wisdom, a bit of insightthe truth.
